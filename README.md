# Cifar10 - Evaluating Model using Data Augmentation
- The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms.
- It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
- The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.
- Computer algorithms for recognizing objects in photos often learn by example. CIFAR-10 is a set of images that can be used to teach a computer how to recognize objects.
- CIFAR-10 is an attractive dataset for experimenting with image classification algorithms due to its low resolution images of 32x32. This allows for faster testing and iteration of different models. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been found to be the most effective in recognizing the images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- The dataset can be easily loaded using popular libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, making it an accessible resource for those looking to train their own image classification models.
